this took me like an hour to write i could careless about cleaing it up 

if you wanna use it you can but just know this is written for my use so the user inputs might be a little weird.

when asked the position of a letter, the position of the letter starts at the 0'th index. lets say 'L' is the first letter, then the position is equal to 0.

i am currently working on the same bot but for JS with a UI that will be eaiser to navigate and understand.

UI Notes 1 (JS):
  create 5 letter boxes (just like wordle) where the user can input their guess.
  after this the user determines which letters are not in the word, which letters are green, and which letters are yellow by clicking on that said box.
  ex. 1 click(c) = turn to green.
      2 click(s) = turn to yellow.
      3 click(s) = reset the box back to gray and reset the click varible to 0 so if the user clicks the box again, the box should be green.
  since i already made an algorithm in python, i am just going to transfer that algorithm over to JS and run through it, removing the words in the back end.
  rinse and repeat steps again.
